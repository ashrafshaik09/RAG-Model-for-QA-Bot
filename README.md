**RAG-Chatbots with LangChain and Pinecone Vector DB**

Building RAG Chatbots with LangChain and Pinecone Vector Database

**Overview**

This repository contains the RAG Model for QA Bot.ipynb Jupyter notebook, which demonstrates the creation and functionality of a chatbot using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique. The chatbot utilizes advanced NLP methods to provide informative and contextually relevant responses, making it an ideal resource for AI-driven conversational agents.

In this project, we will build an AI chatbot using LangChain, OpenAI, and Pinecone's vector DB. The chatbot will be capable of learning from the external world using RAG.

We will use a dataset sourced from the Llama 2 ArXiv paper and other related papers to help our chatbot answer questions about the latest advancements in GenAI.

By the end of this example, we will have a functioning chatbot and RAG pipeline that can hold a conversation and provide informative responses based on a knowledge base.

**Features**

- Chatbot Development: A step-by-step guide on building a chatbot using RAG.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Incorporates RAG to enhance the chatbot's response generation by retrieving relevant information and context.
- Interactive Interface: Users can interact with the chatbot, input their queries, and receive responses.
- Analysis of Chatbot Performance: Insights into the capabilities and limitations of the RAG-based chatbot in various conversational scenarios.

**Prerequisites**

Before building our chatbot, we need to install some Python libraries:

- langchain: A library for GenAI. We'll use it to chain together different language models and components for our chatbot.
- openai: The official OpenAI Python client. We'll use it to interact with the OpenAI API and generate responses for our chatbot.
- datasets: Provides a vast array of datasets for machine learning. We'll use it to load our knowledge base for the chatbot.
- pinecone-client: The official Pinecone Python client. We'll use it to interact with the Pinecone API and store our chatbot's knowledge base in a vector database.
